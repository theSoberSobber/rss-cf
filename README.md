# rss-cf
The idea is to watch this feed through IFTTT/Pushover and get notifs on new entry.
 - Deployment - https://rss-cf.vercel.app/rss

---

### Deployment -
- Idk how to make a IFTTT applet deploy button like for heroku or I would.
- If you wanna deploy then just add the handles you wanna watch in the array in parser.js (or a txt file, whichever I chose) and deploy an applet from IFTTT's site.
